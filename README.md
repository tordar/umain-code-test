## Work Test Intro

Umain is working on setting up a new and exciting restaurant service: Munchies! For all your restaurant needs!
We have a design ready and a backend service up and running. Now we only need a web application so that our users can find the right restaurant for them.

## Requirements

### User stories

- As a user, the first time I open the website, I should see an unfiltered list of all restaurants
- As a user, I should be able to select a filter from the sidebar or the topbar. When I select a filter, the List View should reflect the new updates
- As a user, I should be able to select multiple filters
- As a user, I should be able to deselect a filter by clicking on it. If I deselect any filter(s), the List View should reflect the new updates

### Design

- The web application is implemented with a responsive design, ranging from 375px wide until 1440px wide according to the design in Figma
- Filters have a visual active state

## Umain's Tech Stack and YOU!

At Umain, our main tech stack consists of React, NextJS and TypeScript.
For Content Management, we like to use SanityCMS.
For styling, it is TailwindCSS and/or custom CSS.
You can choose to host your finished product on any hosting provider, such as Google Firebase or Vercel.
For version control, we use GitHub for all our projects.

For this Work Test, you can choose any tech stack you are comfortable with.

## API Docs

[API Docs](https://work-test-web-2024-eze6j4scpq-lz.a.run.app/api-docs/)

## Design

You can find the [link to the design here](https://www.figma.com/file/263XJno7ii0uEaarJP9Ydw/Umain-Tech-Case?type=design&node-id=27%3A5682&mode=design&t=BPI3BgkmmHVtTdCb-1).
There are 2 pages in Figma, called App and Web. App is used for the mobile view. Web is used for the desktop view.
To get the right fonts, colors, sizes and more, please refer to the design in Figma. You should be able to get this info from the components and styles.

## All done?

:star: Awesome, great job! :star:
The next thing is that a Umain developer will take a look at your finished web application and your code.
Here are a few ways to get your project to us:

- You could ZIP your project and send it over
- Share it from a Cloud solution to Umain (e.g. Google Drive)
- You could share your repo (if public) so that we can clone and install locally
